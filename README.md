# CodeIgniter-Barebone-Admin-Panel-Bootstrap-4
Instructions:

1) Install the .sql file to your MySQL database
2) Change the base_url in application/config/config.php
3) Change the salt in application/model/Admin_model.php to something else random
4) Login with user: admin password: admin


I made this because there are so many projects I want to do where I need a basic admin login with potential for administrative roles.

You are free to use it, but please don't fork it, and when you show your job recruiter your sample code don't send mine.
